# How to solve a problem

## Approaching the problem

1. Clarify the question

   - Don't solve the wrong problem
   - State concrete instance of the problem
   - Ask time and space complexity for your solution

2. Work on concrete examples

   - use smallest amount of change

3. Spell out the brute force solution

   - helps you explore optimization and reach better solution
   - demonstrate some problem solving and coding skills

4. Think out loud

    - to stay engaged and coherent

5. Apply patterns
